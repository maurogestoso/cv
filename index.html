Participated in the whole planning phase, several design workshops and volunteered for research and feature validation with real users
Collaborated closely with the designer to develop the UI and improve the UX on a very limited touchscreen device
Introduced new technologies that enabled rapid iteration and improved code maintainability such as TailwindCSS and TypeScript.
Collaborated with backend and SRE engineers on system monitoring, the deployment strategy and automation that allowed us to scale up from one to hundreds of stores.

Improved the delivery experience with features such as Premium Delivery, Click & Collect, better status tracking and integrating with multiple courier services
Scaled massively the application’s back-end systems in response to the COVID-19 crisis thanks to our use of serverless technologies

Managed a team of 5 instructors and 20-30 students at a time.
Spend countless hours pair programming and debugging students’ random issues. I have stories to tell.
Other jobs
I’ve fixed engines, designed a chemical plant in the Black Sea, managed a Makerspace, taught Math to pay for university, milked goats, felled trees and restored an old stone house in the countryside where I now live. I’m happy to talk about the many transferable skills I learned 😀

SKILLS
⌨️ Fluent in JavaScript/TypeScript/NodeJS and very comfortable in the React ecosystem (Redux, hooks, Next.js, etc.). Experience with Golang and Python. I lean Frontend, but I’m not scared to get my hands dirty in other parts of the stack.
🚀 Well versed in agile practices, user-focused and iterative product development, data-driven and user research-based decisions. Active participant in non-engineering meetings and team rituals.
☁️ Experienced building, deploying and monitoring systems using AWS services. I’ve particularly enjoyed working with serverless architectures
🚨 Comfortable owning the whole development cycle: deployments, maintaining CI/CD pipelines, monitoring production systems, providing technical support. “It’s not done until it’s working in production”.
👌 Big advocate for industry best practices: rapid iteration, learning from users, testing and TDD, pair programming, code reviews, but most importantly: keeping things simple. “The solution is not always writing more code.”
😀 Excellent communication skills in both Spanish🇪🇸 and English🇬🇧. I put a lot of effort into explaining things clearly, summarizing and simplifying, always paying attention to the context and who’s listening. 
👫 Experience onboarding and mentoring new members of the team, interviewing candidates, delivering talks and workshops internally and at public events, teaching beginners.
