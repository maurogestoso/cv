          <li>Fluent in JavaScript/TypeScript/NodeJS and very comfortable in the React ecosystem (Redux, hooks, Next.js,

            whole stack.</li>
          <li>Good foundations of HTML, CSS and browser APIs. Not everything has to be an SPA.</li>
          <li>Well versed in agile practices, user-focused and iterative product development, data-driven and user
            research-based decisions. Active participant in non-engineering meetings and team rituals.</li>

          <li>Excellent communication skills in both Spanish (native) and English (fluent, speak it at home). I put a
