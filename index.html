        <ul>
          <li>Fluent in JavaScript/TypeScript/NodeJS and very comfortable in the React ecosystem (Redux, hooks, Next.js,
            etc.). Experience with Golang and Python. I lean Frontend, but I’m not scared to get my hands dirty in the
            whole stack.</li>
          <li>Well versed in agile practices, user-focused and iterative product development, data-driven and user
            research-based decisions. Active participant in non-engineering meetings and team rituals.</li>
          <li>Experienced building, deploying and monitoring systems using AWS services. I’ve particularly enjoyed
            working with serverless architectures</li>
          <li>Comfortable owning the whole development cycle: deployments, maintaining CI/CD pipelines, monitoring
            production systems, providing technical support. “It’s not done until it’s working in production”.</li>
          <li>Active advocate for industry best practices: rapid iteration, learning from users, testing at the right
            level, pair programming, code reviews, but most importantly: keeping things simple. “The solution is not
            always writing more code.”</li>
          <li>Excellent communication skills in both Spanish (native) and English (fluent, speak it at home). I put a
            lot of effort into explaining things clearly, summarizing and simplifying, always paying attention to the
            context and who’s listening. </li>
          <li>Experience onboarding and mentoring new members of the team, interviewing candidates, delivering talks and
            workshops internally and at public events. I love teaching beginners.</li>

        <p>I’ve done some informal freelance frontend jobs (there are horror stories), fixed engines, designed a
          chemical plant in the Black Sea, managed a Makerspace, taught Maths to pay for
          university, grown vegetables, milked goats, felled trees, reared animals, laid bricks, plumbed and restored an
          old stone house in
          the countryside where I now live.
          I’m happy to talk about the many transferable skills I learned 😀
